    "Earlier in my blog post, we have learn about hypothesis testing. Based on the difference of 30% in female vs male being promoted, we want to know if the difference makes two variable independent vs dependent. The Null Hypothesis said that is due to chance. The alternative said, there's dependant variable and some relationship. Using simulation earlier we know that achieving 0.3 is very rare using simulation. If there's no strong evidence, we stick to the Null Hypothesis, but if we do we reject the Null Hypothesis in favor of the alternative. We can do this by using CLT, like in the Kloud score example.\n",
