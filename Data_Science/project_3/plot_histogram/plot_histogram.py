    Before we perform any analysis, it might be useful to take a
    look at the data we're hoping to analyze. More specifically, lets 
    examine the hourly entries in our NYC subway data and determine what
    distribution the data follows. This data is stored in a dataframe
    called turnstile_weather under the ['ENTRIESn_hourly'] column.
    
    Why don't you plot two histograms on the same axes, showing hourly
    entries when raining vs. when not raining. Here's an example on how
    to plot histograms with pandas and matplotlib:
    turnstile_weather['column_to_graph'].hist()
    
    Your histograph may look similar to the following graph:

    You can read a bit about using matplotlib and pandas to plot
    histograms:

    You can look at the information contained within the turnstile weather data at the link below:

    '''
    plt.figure()
    turnstile_weather['ENTRIESn_hourly'][turnstile_weather.rain == 1].hist() # your code here to plot a historgram for hourly entries when it is raining
    turnstile_weather['ENTRIESn_hourly'][turnstile_weather.rain == 0].hist() # your code here to plot a historgram for hourly entries when it is not raining
    return plt
