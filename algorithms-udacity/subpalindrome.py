# User Instructions
#
# Write a function, longest_subpalindrome_slice(text) that takes
# a string as input and returns the i and j indices that
# correspond to the beginning and end indices of the longest
# palindrome in the string.
#
# Grading Notes:
#
# You will only be marked correct if your function runs
# efficiently enough. We will be measuring efficency by counting
# the number of times you access each string. That count must be
# below a certain threshold to be marked correct.
#
# Please do not use regular expressions to solve this quiz!

def longest_subpalindrome_slice(text):
    "Return (i, j) such that text[i:j] is the longest palindrome in text."
    # Your code here

#The idea is we find 3 letter form palindrome and append that to the list
#Then from there, if there's
