      "With separate training and testing dataset, we would know how are the performance of our learning model against dataset that haven't been seen. In this way we know how our model generalize if there's new examples. It also acts as a background check whether your model is overfitting. It may cause dataset shortage, but it's kind of step that is worth for. Keep in mind that every machine learning algorithm fit in the training set, not in a test set. If you fit in a test set, and score also in the test set, you definitely would have high performance. And that's called tremendous CHEATING in machine learning.\n",
